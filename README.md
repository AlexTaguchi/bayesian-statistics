Overview of Bayesian statistics and its applications in machine learning

### Comparison of Frequentist and Bayesian statistics
- Frequentist statistics: The probability of observing a particular event is calculated by considering only how often it has happened in the past.
- Bayesian statistics: The probability of observing a particuluar event considers both how often it has happened in the past and the conditions associated with it happening (or not happening).
